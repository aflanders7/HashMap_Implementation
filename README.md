# About the Project
This program implements HashMaps with collision resolution. Both HashMaps were implemented
with underlying dynamic arrays.
For the OA HashMap, collisions are resolved with open addressing via quadratic probing.
For the SC HashMap, collisions are resolved with chaining via a singly linked list.
The SC HashMap was used to find the mode(s) and corresponding frequency for any given dynamic array.
